# Data_Analysis_On_Indian_AQI

Air Quality Index (AQI) is a number used to convey the quality of air by the government to the general public. Air quality deteriorates with an increase in the concentration of pollutants. The Air Quality Index represents the severity of pollution for ordinary people. Using this data, it is possible to make predictions by taking data from any area or place. 

This file contains an analysis of air quality data in India. It is a Jupyter notebook that includes Python code for data analysis using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. The dataset includes information on various air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), suspended particulate matter (SPM), and particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5). The analysis involves data preprocessing, visualization, and possibly machine learning modeling, as indicated by the use of the Scikit-learn library. The dataset contains over 400,000 rows and 13 columns, with information on different monitoring stations, sampling dates, states, and pollutant levels. The summary statistics provided in the file give an overview of the central tendency and dispersion of the pollutant levels in the dataset
